# GSTN-523-multi-model-classifier

Multi-model binary classification project using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a binary classification model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict a binary outcome based on a set of input features. The project implements three classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, to achieve high predictive performance. The methodology includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables
- Implementation of three classification algorithms:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC)
- Visualizations of model performance and confusion matrices

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`
- `imbalanced-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost imbalanced-learn
```
