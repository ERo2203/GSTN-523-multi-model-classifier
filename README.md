# GSTN-523-multi-model-classifier

Multi-model binary classification project using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a binary classification model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict a binary outcome based on a set of input features. The project implements three classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, to achieve high predictive performance. The methodology includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables
- Implementation of three classification algorithms:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC)
- Visualizations of model performance and confusion matrices

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`
- `imbalanced-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost imbalanced-learn
```

## Using Google Colab

We recommend using **Google Colab** to run this project. Colab provides an interactive environment where you can execute Python code easily without local setup. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run the following command in a code cell to clone this repository:

   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/ERo2203/GSTN-523-multi-model-classifier.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   %cd GSTN-523-multi-model-classifier
   ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Since Colab does not come with all the libraries pre-installed, run this command in a cell:

   ```bash
   !pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost imbalanced-learn
   ```

5. **Run the Code**:
   - You can now open and run the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `binary_classification.ipynb`) within Google Colab. Execute each cell sequentially by clicking the play button.

6. **Save Your Work**:
   - You can save your changes directly to Google Drive or download the notebook to your local machine.
